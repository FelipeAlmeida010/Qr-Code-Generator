# Qr-Code-Generator



*Hello, my name is Felipe Joseph!**

I'm a Full Stack Jr Web developer,
I'm currently taking a graduation course
in Systems Analysis and Development./*

## About the project:

## It was developed in React with CSS and JavaScript e Typescript

Based on the described functionality of the application, 
I decided to make the screen display simpler through just two fields, 
one for placing the name, 
and another that can be used for both the linkedIn and GitHub profiles.

I also added the functionality to change the Qr Code in real time 
as the user enters the link, the Qr code changes simultaneously.

**I also added the option to download the Qr code in .png image format**

/*Project commands*/

### project creation command: `yarn create react-app "Name of project" -- template typescript`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Libraries used:

 `yarn add react-qr-code`

 `yarn add qrcode`

## About the backend:

I didn't implement the backend because I couldn't visualize a usual application for storing information, 
since the link can be dynamic, 
maybe a proposal would be to store the data of each user, 
but I couldn't visualize a practical sense to store this information.
